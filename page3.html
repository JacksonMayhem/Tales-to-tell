        And so Gaia, mad with grief, went to her titan sons and daughters, and told them that their father was to die for what he had done, and the titan or titaness brave enough to do the deed would receive the universe as their prize. And yet their father was so fearsome, that all but one hesitated. Kronos the Crooked One, the youngest of the twelve, stepped up to kill his father. In gratitude for his bravery, Gaia went to deppest part of the earth and fashioned him the first scythe ever made, out of adamantium, the hardest, rarest ore that could be found, to easier kill his father with.

        And so Kronos went to his four brothers, for Oceanus had left, and said that each of them that helped him slay his father would recieve one corner of the world in return. And so Kronos tricked his father into coming down, where his four brothers held down one limb each, and then, just before Kronos had swung, Ouranos said &quot;Just as you jave betrayed me, my child, so too, will your own children.&quot; And, ignoring the prophecy, Kronos hacked at his father, and threw the shredded remains into the ocean, to spite the brother that had abondoned them. Little did he know that those remains would come back to shake the heavens to their very core in years to come. But that's a story for another day.

        And so Kronos freed his brothers from Tarturus, and in return they built him a castle on top of the tallest mountain. Kronos then wed his sister Rhea, where one day, he would recieve the meal that cost him his life. The end.
