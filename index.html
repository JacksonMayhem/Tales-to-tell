    <header><h3>Now let me tell you one of the stories from the ancient times.</h3></header>

    <h1>Like all beginnings.</h1>
        <p>
            In the beginning, like all beginnings, there was chaos. But in this version, chaos got bored with nothing. So it created the earth, the sun, and the moon. The newborn planet named herself Gaia. Her entire body was the planet itself, the very planet that we walk on today.
        </p>
        <p>
            Everyday she would look up at the empty black void of nothingness that was chaos, and would yearn for someone to share all her beauty with. Whether it was her or chaos that made him, we shall never know, but eventually, Ouranos was born into this world. His body was the sky itself. After this chaos started making more beings that would eventually be called the primordial deities.
        </p>
        <p>
            The moment Gaia saw Ouranos, and Ouranos saw Gaia, they fell in love. They wed each other and one day had twelve children they called the titans. They had six sons who they named:
        </p> 
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Oceanus: titan of the ocean and water</li>
                <li>Hyperion: titan of the west and light</li>
                <li>Koios: titan of the north and wisdom</li>
                <li>Krios: titan of the south and the constellations</li>
                <li>Iapetus: titan of the east and mortality</li>
                <li>Kronos: titan of time</li>
            </ol>    
                    <section>
                        <p>And six daughters they named:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Tethys: titaness of fresh water</li>
                            <li>Thea: titaness of clear sight and radiance</li>
                            <li>Pheobe: titaness of propehcy and intellect</li>
                            <li>Mnemosyne: titaness of memory and writing</li>
                            <li>Themis: titaness of law and fair justice</li>
                            <li>Rhea: titaness of fertility and comfort</li>
                        </ol>

            After this Ouranos returned to the sky, for a long time. Eventually Gaia grew lonely and called him down to have more children. And the pair produced three children. But they disgusted Ouranos, as they only had one eye in the middle of their forehead. In his revulsion Ouranos took chains from the godess of night, Nyx, and bound the Cyclopes in the chains of darkness, and tossed them into the worst place you could possibly go. The ethereal, eternal, pits of Tarturus. The place where monsters like Cerberus, The Hydra, and many more are born. Gaia only had time to name the three Cyclopes: Arges, meaning Vividly Bright, Brontes, meaning Thunder Man, and Steropes, meaning Lightning Man.

        <p>
            As you can guess, Gaia was enraged and in grief. She begged her husband to let them go, but his will was as solid as the mountains of the earth. So she tried to sate his revulsion by siring more children with him. And once again, she gave birth to three monsters. They were called the Hecatonchieres or Hundred-Handers for they had one hundred hands and fifty heads, each with a different expression on its face. And once again Gaia had just barely named them, Cottus, Briares, and Gyges, when Ouranos bound them with Nyx's chains of darkness and threw them into tarturus.

        And so Gaia, mad with grief, went to her titan sons and daughters, and told them that their father was to die for what he had done, and the titan or titaness brave enough to do the deed would receive the universe as their prize. And yet their father was so fearsome, that all but one hesitated. Kronos the Crooked One, the youngest of the twelve, stepped up to kill his father. In gratitude for his bravery, Gaia went to deppest part of the earth and fashioned him the first scythe ever made, out of adamantium, the hardest, rarest ore that could be found, to easier kill his father with.
    </p>
    <p>
        And so Kronos went to his four brothers, for Oceanus had left, and said that each of them that helped him slay his father would recieve one corner of the world in return. And so Kronos tricked his father into coming down, where his four brothers held down one limb each, and then, just before Kronos had swung, Ouranos said &quot;Just as you jave betrayed me, my child, so too, will your own children.&quot; And, ignoring the prophecy, Kronos hacked at his father, and threw the shredded remains into the ocean, to spite the brother that had abondoned them. Little did he know that those remains would come back to shake the heavens to their very core in years to come. But that's a story for another day.
    </p>
    <p>
        And so Kronos freed his brothers from Tarturus, and in return they built him a castle on top of the tallest mountain. Kronos then wed his sister Rhea, where one day, he would recieve the meal that cost him his life. The end.
