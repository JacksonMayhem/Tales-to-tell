            After this Ouranos returned to the sky, for a long time. Eventually Gaia grew lonely and called him down to have more children. And the pair produced three children. But they disgusted Ouranos, as they only had one eye in the middle of their forehead. In his revulsion Ouranos took chains from the godess of night, Nyx, and bound the Cyclopes in the chains of darkness, and tossed them into the worst place you could possibly go. The ethereal, eternal, pits of Tarturus. The place where monsters like Cerberus, The Hydra, and many more are born. Gaia only had time to name the three Cyclopes: Arges, meaning Vividly Bright, Brontes, meaning Thunder Man, and Steropes, meaning Lightning Man.

            As you can guess, Gaia was enraged and in grief. She begged her husband to let them go, but his will was as solid as the mountains of the earth. So she tried to sate his revulsion by siring more children with him. And once again, she gave birth to three monsters. They were called the Hecatonchieres or Hundred-Handers for they had one hundred hands and fifty heads, each with a different expression on its face. And once again Gaia had just barely named them, Cottus, Briares, and Gyges, when Ouranos bound them with Nyx's chains of darkness and threw them into tarturus.
